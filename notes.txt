Executing a Go program
    go run <program.go>

Creating a build
    go build <program.go>

Cross Compilation
    Environment variables
        go env

    Environment variables for build
        GOOS, GOARCH

    To change the Environment variables
        go env -w var1=<val1> var2=<val2>

    To cross compile:
        GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build <program.go>

    To get the list of GOOS & GOARCH
        go tool dist list
    

Higher Order Functions
    Functions as first class objects (functions as data)
    - assign functions to variables
    - pass functions as arguments to other functions
    - return functions as return results
Variadic functions
    - 

Errors

Deferred Functions

Panic

Collections
    Array
        Fixed size collection 

    Slice
        Varying size collection
        Internally maintains a pointer to an array
        append()

    Map
        Key-Value pairs collection
